### What is Docker?

* Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
* Apps are packaged in **containers** that can be run on many OS
* Apps run the same, regardless of where they're run
  * Any machine
  * No compatibility issues
  * Predictable behavior
  * Less work
  * Easier to maintain and deploy
  * Works with any language, any OS, any technology
* Use-cases: microservices architecture, lift and shift apps from on-premises to the AWS cloud,...

#### Docker on an OS

<img src="../images/ecs-fargate-ecr-eks/how-docker-works.png" alt="How docker works">

#### Docker Containers Management on AWS

* **Amazon Elastic Container Service(Amazon ECS)**
  * Amazon's own container platform
* **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service(Amazon EKS)**
  * Amazon's managed Kubernetes(open source)
* **Amazon Fargate**
  * Amazon's own Serverless container platform
  * Works with ECS and with EKS
* **Amazon ECR**
  * Store container images

### Amazon ECS - EC2 Launch Type

* Launch Docker containers on AWS = Launch **ECS Tasks** on ECS Clusters
* **EC2 Launch Type: you must provision & maintain the infrastructure(the EC2 instances)**
* Each EC2 instance must run the **ECS Agent** to register in the ECS Cluster
* AWS takes care of starting/stopping containers

<img src="../images/ecs-fargate-ecr-eks/ec2-launch-type.png" alt="EC2 Launch Type">

### Amazon ECS - Fargate Launch Type

* Launch Docket container on AWS
* **You do not provision the infrastructure(no EC2 instances to manage)**
* **It's all Serverless!**
* You just create task definitions
* AWS just run ECS Tasks for you based on the COU/Ram you need
* To scale, you increase the number of task. Simple - no more EC2 instances


#### Amazon ECS - IAM Roles for ECS

* **EC2 Instance Profile(EC2 Launch Type only):**
  * Used by the ECS agent
  * Makes API calls to ECS service
  * Send container logs to CloudWatch Logs
  * Pull Docker images from ECR
  * Reference sensitive data in Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store
  
* **ECS Task Role:**
  * Allow each task to have a specific role
  * Use different roles for the different ECS Services you run
  * Task Role is defined in the **task definition**

#### Amazon ECS - Load Balancer Integrations

* **Application Load Balancer** supported and works for most use cases
* **Network Load Balancer** recommended only for high throughput / high performance use cases, or to pair it with AWS Private Link
* **Classic Load Balancer** supported but not recommended(no advanced features - no Fargate)

#### Amazon ECS - Data Volumes

* Mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks
* Works for both **EC2** and **Fargate** launch types
* Tasks running in any AZ will share the same data in the EFS file system
* **Fargate + EFS = Serverless**
* Use-cases: persistent multi-AZ shared storage for your containers
* Note: Amazon S3 cannot be mounted as a file system

#### ECS Service Auto Scaling

* Automatically increase/decrease the desired number of ECS tasks
* Amazon ECS Auto Scaling uses **AWS Application Auto Scaling**
  * ECS Service Average CPU Utilization
  * ECS Service Average Memory Utilization - Scale on RAM
  * ALB Request Count Per Target - metrics coming from the ALB
  
* **Target Tracking** - scale based on target value for a specific CloudWatch metric
* **Step Scaling** - scale based on a specified CloudWatch Alarm
* **Scheduled Scaling** - scale based on a specified date/time(predictable change)

* ECS Service Auto Scaling(task level) != EC2 Auto Scaling(EC2 instance level)
* Fargate Auto Scaling is much easier to set up(because **Serverless**)

#### EC2 Launch Type - Auto Scaling EC2 Instances

* Accommodate ECS Service Scaling by adding underlying EC2 Instances

* **Auto Scaling Group Scaling**
  * Scale your ASG based on CPU Utilization
  * Add EC2 instances over time

* **ECS Cluster Capacity Provider**
  * Used to automatically provision and scale the infrastructure for your ECS Tasks
  * Capacity Provider paired with an Auto Scaling Group
  * Add EC2 Instances when you're missing capacity(CPU, RAM,...)

#### ECS Scaling - Service CPU Usage Example

### Amazon EKS 

* Amazon EKS = Amazon Elastic **Kubernetes** Service
* It is a way to launch **managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS**
* Kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling and management of containerized(usually Docker) application
* It's an alternative to ECS, similar goal but different API
* EKS supports **EC2** if you want to deploy worker nodes or **Fargate** to deploy serverless containers
* Use case: if your company is already using Kubernetes on-premises or in another cloud, and wants to migrate to AWS using Kubernetes.
* Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic(can be used in any cloud - Azure, GCP...)

#### Amazon EKS - Node Types

* **Managed Node Groups**
  * Creates and manages Nodes(EC2 instances) for you
  * Nodes are part of an ASG managed by EKS
  * Supports On-Demand or Spot Instances
  
* **Self-Managed Nodes**
  * Nodes created by you and registered to the EKS cluster and managed by an ASG
  * You can use prebuilt AMI - Amazon EKS Optimized AMI
  * Support On-Demand or Spot Instances

* **AWS Fargate**
  * No maintenance required; no nodes managed

#### Amazon EKS - Data Volumes

* Need to specify **StorageClass** manifest on your EKS cluster
* Leverages a **Container Storage Interface** compliant driver
* Support for...
  * Amazon EBS
  * Amazon EFS
  * Amazon FSx for Lustre
  * Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

### AWS App Runner

* Fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy web applications and APIs at scale
* No infrastructure experience required
* Start with you source code or container image
* Automatically builds and deploy the web app
* Automatic scaling, highly available, load balancer, encryption 
* VPC access support
* Connect to database, cache, and message queue services
* Use cases: web apps, APIs, microservices, rapid production deployments
