### Well Architected Framework General Guiding Principles

* Stop guessing your capacity needs
* Test systems at production scale
* Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
* Allow for evolutionary architectures
  * Design based on changing requirements
* Drive architecture using data
* Improve through game days
  * Simulate applications for flash sale days

#### 6 Pillars

* Operational Excellence
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance Efficiency
* Cost Optimization
* Sustainability

* They are not something to balance or trade-off, they are a synergy

### Trusted Advisor

* No need to install anything - high level AWS account assessment
* Analyze your AWS accounts and provides recommendatation on 6 categories:
  * Cost optimization
  * Performance
  * Security
  * Fault tolerance
  * Service limits
  * Operational Excellence
* Business& Enterprise Support Plan
  * Full Set of checks
  * Programmatic Access using AWS Support API

### More Architecture Examples

* We've explored the most important architectural patterns
  * Classic: EC2, ELB, RDS, ElasiCache, etc...
  * Serverless: S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFront, API Gateway, etc...
